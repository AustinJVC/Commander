#  Security

This document outlines the security practices and vulnerability reporting process for the Commander project.

## 1. Supported Versions

We currently only consider security vulnerabilities in the main branch of the project.

## 2. Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the project, please follow these steps:

**Do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been addressed.  
Send an email to commander@austinvc.ca with a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:  
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Optional Patch or workaround for the vulnerability (if available)  

We will acknowledge your report within 4 business days and work towards a fix as soon as possible. We will keep you informed of the progress and notify you once a fix is released.

## 3. Bounty Program

We currently do not offer a bug bounty program. However, we appreciate all security researchers who help improve the security of our project.

## 4. Security Best Practices

Here are some recommendations to help you use the project securely:

- Keep the project software up-to-date.
